# DuckyCoding presents: @scripts

A collection of useful scripts to handle various tasks:
- scaffold entire projects
- unify other tools in a single command
- rename entire directories with all their subdirectories
- ...

This repo is managed as a Monorepo using Workspaces, powered by Bun.

Leveraging Bun's ability to run native TypeScript files, there probably won't be any build output: just make sure you have the latest version of Bun installed ([here's the official guide on how to do it](https://bun.sh/docs/installation)) and you are ready to go!

Feel free to submit any script request by creating a [new issue here](https://github.com/duckycoding-dev/scripts/issues/new?template=Blank+issue) using the `request` label.

If you find any issues with the existing scripts also feel free to [create a new issue](https://github.com/duckycoding-dev/scripts/issues/new?template=Blank+issue) and label it as `bug` please.

Enjoy, quack! ðŸ¦†:)
